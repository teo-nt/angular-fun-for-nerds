# Fun For Nerds

This project is a simple game created with Angular.

- The user starts typing a word and depending on the length of the word it oscillates whether it will pass as input to the "even length words" or the "odd length words".
- Until the user presses the "Submit" button, the word, depending on its current length, is displayed in red either in one Component or the other.
- When the user presses the "Submit" button then the word is "locked" to the Component corresponding to its length.
- The two Components that display the words keep a history of the words that the user has locked so far.
